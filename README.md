## Current Features

This Application helps modding stellaris by:

- finding files overwritten by multiple mods
- create automatic patches as for text-based files(if possible)
- consider dependants as desired collisions(i.e. not re-patching)

## Future Plans

See the [issue tracker for enhancement](https://github.com/Idrinths-Stellaris-Mods/Mod-Tools/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) and feel free to add some more.

## Alternatives

There are two more Mod Managers:

- [Emurian Mod Manager for Stellaris](https://steamcommunity.com/app/281990/discussions/0/133259956022179056/), that is strictly for windows with no (known) intention to expand the support to other operating systems.
- [SCModManager](https://github.com/WojciechKrysiak/SCModManager/) is also for windows only currently and features a nice conflict-view
